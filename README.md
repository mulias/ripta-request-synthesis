# Rhode Island Public Transit Authority transportation search and synthesis

In 2016 RIPTA released a new API for tracking buses and querying for public
transit routes. This script pulls current bus data (assuming the API still
exists in the same place) and asks the user a series of questions to narrow
down the list of active routes. Finally it returns the current status of the
desired bus route.
